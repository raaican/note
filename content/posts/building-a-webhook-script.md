## Progress

Currently working on a Bash script to expedite sending a webhook to a Discord server. This saves so much time (5 - 10 minutes) to send a webhook message.

## Features
- Interactive Bash script;
- Status of *sent* messages;
- Logging;
- Exit command (/exit);
- Embed command (/embed);

## To do
+ Custom webhook address input;
+ Config file;
+ Webhook address selector. Configurable via config file;
+ Settings. Such as adding a new webhook address, etc;
+ Change to a different language(?), for configurable flexibility;
+ Look for a config file format. Maybe TOML;
